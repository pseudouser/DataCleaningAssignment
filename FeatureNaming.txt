Features captured and naming:

All accelerometer and gyroscope time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz across 3 axes – “X”, “Y” and “Z”. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. These signals were then separated into “body” and “gravity” acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain “jerk” signals. 
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the base signals.

Feature naming [in order of appearance in feature name]
angle: Angle between two vectors.
prefix t/f: denotes whether the signals are time signals or whether they indicate frequency domain signals (which were derived by applying an FFT to the base signals)
Body/Gravity – indicates whether the signals were separated into Body or Gravity acceleration signals
Acc/Gyro – indicates whether the signals were obtained from the Accelerometer or Gyroscope
Jerk – indicates the Jerk signals derived in time from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity 
Mag – indicates the Magnitude of these three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm

mean/std/mad/max/min/sma/energy/iqr/entropy/arCoeff/maxInds/meanFreq/skewness/kurtosis/bandsEnergy – indicates which function was applied to the signals obtained
mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
mad: Median absolute deviation 
max: Largest value in array
min: Smallest value in array
sma: Signal magnitude area
energy: Energy measure; calculated as sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr: Interquartile range 
entropy: Signal entropy
arCoeff: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation: correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness: skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis: kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy: Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.

X/Y/Z – indicates which axis the signals measured pertained to – X, Y or Z
